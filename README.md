# Hi, I’m Tatsiana👋

I work at the intersection of **engineering, product strategy, and responsible AI**, helping teams ship reliable, scalable, and trustworthy products — from early prototypes to production-scale platforms.

My background spans QA, automation, AI/LLM evaluation, business analysis, and startup delivery, with experience across both **early-stage teams** and **enterprise environments**.

---

## What I focus on

### 🧠 AI systems & LLM evaluation
- Testing AI-powered features beyond “happy paths”
- Output consistency, edge cases, bias signals, and prompt robustness
- Translating responsible AI principles into **practical delivery workflows**

### 🔗 Integrations & third-party services
- API reliability, contract validation, and failure-mode analysis
- Testing system behavior under partial outages, degraded dependencies, and data drift
- Designing guardrails for systems that don’t fully belong to you

### 🔍 Audits (practical, not bureaucratic)
- Fairness, transparency, and reliability audits for AI-enabled features
- Delivery-focused audits that surface risks early — before they become incidents
- Lightweight governance that supports speed, not slows it down

### 🚀 Product & delivery
- Turning ambiguous requirements into shippable systems
- Supporting MVPs through scale-up and long-term operation
- Aligning engineering, product, and business around shared outcomes

## Why this GitHub exists

This space exists to share:

- Reference architectures
- Playbooks and frameworks
- Experiments and tools
- Decision-making patterns

Everything here is **intentionally small, opinionated, and documented** — focused on how decisions are made, not just how code is written.

## Featured work

📘 **Fairness Audit Playbook**  
A practitioner-first framework for evaluating AI systems in real product environments.  
→ _From principles to concrete checks, tests, and delivery decisions._

- 🧠 Topics I enjoy discussing: AI delivery, audits, startups, system reliability, product strategy — and staying balanced with running… and occasionally lying on a soft bed pretending it counts as recovery:)

Hi, I’m Tatsiana. I love using technology to solve real-world problems, especially where AI, complex systems, and integrations come together. I help turn challenging ideas into products that are reliable, responsible, and ready to scale from prototype to production. Along the way, I focus on embedding practical AI practices, audits, and clear workflows that make teams more effective.
## 🚀 Featured work

📘 **Fairness Audit Playbook**  
A practitioner-first framework for evaluating AI systems in real product environments.  
→ _From principles to concrete checks, tests, and delivery decisions._

## Let’s connect

- 💼 [LinkedIn]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tatsianamark)) 
- 🧠 Topics I enjoy discussing: AI delivery, audits, startups, system reliability, product strategy — and staying balanced with running… and occasionally lying on a soft bed pretending it counts as recovery:) 

This space exists to share:

- Reference architectures
- Playbooks and frameworks
- Experiments and tools
- Decision-making patterns

Everything here is **intentionally small, opinionated, and documented** — focused on how decisions are made, not just how code is written.

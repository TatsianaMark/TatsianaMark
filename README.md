Hi, I’m Tatsiana👋 I work at the intersection of **engineering, product strategy, and responsible AI**, helping teams ship reliable, scalable, and trustworthy products — from early prototypes to production-scale platforms.

My background spans QA, automation, AI/LLM evaluation, business analysis, and startup delivery, with experience across both **early-stage teams** and **enterprise environments**.


### What I focus on 

#### - AI systems & LLM evaluation
#### - Integrations & third-party services
#### - Audits (practical, not bureaucratic)
#### - Product & delivery

## 🚀 Featured work

📘 **Fairness Audit Playbook**  
A practitioner-first framework for evaluating AI systems in real product environments.  
→ _From principles to concrete checks, tests, and delivery decisions._

## Let’s connect

- 💼 [LinkedIn]([url](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tatsianamark)) 
- 🧠 Topics I enjoy discussing: AI delivery, audits, startups, system reliability, product strategy — and staying balanced with running… and occasionally lying on a soft bed pretending it counts as recovery:) 

This space exists to share:

- Reference architectures
- Playbooks and frameworks
- Experiments and tools
- Decision-making patterns

Everything here is **intentionally small, opinionated, and documented** — focused on how decisions are made, not just how code is written.
